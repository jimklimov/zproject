    Classes are automatically added to all build environments. Further as you
    add new classes to your project you can generate skeleton header and source
    files according to http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21.

        You need not specify subdependencies if they are implied.
        Dependencies that support the autotools build system are automatically
        built by travis ci if you supply a git repository or a tarball URI.
        Set type to "runtime" to have the packages install-depend on it rather
        than build-depend (default type is "build").
        The travis ci will use the installed packages when building instead of
        rebuilding if available.

        you how to use them. Also have a look at the CZMQ docs to learn more
        about actors.
